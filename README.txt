REPLICATION:
This replication file is composed for the following do files:
*00data_creation contains the creation of the databases used as inputs in the rest of the files.
*01main_text contains the replication of the tables from the main text.
*02annex_a contains the replication of the tables from annex A. 
*03annex_b contains the replication of the tables from annex B.
*04figures contains the replication of the figures from the whole text.


SOME COMMENTS:

*02annex_a: 
**we were unable to replicate bounding effects due to attrition (Tables A14-A16). We provide the code we used, which produces a different outcome. However, our conclusions remain valid.
**in Table A8, we mistakenly copied the F value from Table A5. However, with the correct F values, the conclusion remains the same.
**in Table A17, the z-value is reported incorrectly, but the conclusion remains the same.

*03annex_b: 
**there are slight differences in the creation of these tables compared to those in the main text, as the tables in this file were created for a previous working paper, and we did not note the differences when creating the new version. However, these differences do not impact our conclusions. The differences are: (i) the creation of the variables “Expenses on necessities” and “Discretionary expenses”; and (ii) the use of the lagged value of “Discretionary expenses” as a control in the second set of columns in Table B5 and Table B6.
**in Table B6, we were unable to replicate the last row, but this does not affect our conclusion.
